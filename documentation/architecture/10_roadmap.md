# Roadmap Highlights (18 Months)

Obsinity is not just an idea; it has a clear path forward.

## R1–R2
Lay the foundation: ingestion, registry, counters/gauges/histograms, retention, and masking. Early adopters get a usable, compliant core.

## R3–R4
Expand the query model: richer filters, joins, and flow views. Add management UX and polish the SDK. This is where adoption accelerates.

## R5–R6
Push into advanced analytics: streak detection, anomaly hooks, optimized queries, and hardened operations. Obsinity matures into a platform enterprises can bet on.

## UI/UX
Obsinity will grow beyond APIs. Native **dashboard tiles** will provide a DevX-inspired experience, showing service health, latency histograms, error counters, and flow KPIs — without leaving the platform.

## Grafana Support
At the same time, Obsinity embraces the ecosystem. Packaged dashboards and connection templates for Grafana make integration frictionless.

## Why It Matters
A roadmap signals seriousness. Obsinity isn’t a toy; it’s a platform with ambition, direction, and discipline.
