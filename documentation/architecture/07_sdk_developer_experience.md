# SDK & Developer Experience

A platform lives or dies by how developers feel using it. Obsinity puts **developer joy** at the center.

## Java SDK
Obsinity’s SDK is not a bolt-on library; it’s a companion. With `TelemetryHolder` and annotations like `@Flow`, `@Step`, and `@OnEvent`, developers can instrument code without boilerplate. It feels natural, not forced.

## Contracts
The SDK enforces contracts: `service.id` is mandatory, attributes should be namespaced, and context flows automatically. This ensures telemetry is consistent across teams — no more brittle ad-hoc logging.

## Why It Matters
When observability is painful, developers skip it. Obsinity makes it pleasant, predictable, and even elegant. That’s how adoption sticks.
