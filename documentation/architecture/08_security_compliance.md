# Security, Governance & Compliance

Enterprises live under the shadow of regulation. Obsinity makes compliance a feature, not a burden.

## Data Protection
By default, Obsinity assumes no PII should ever be ingested. Attribute masking is configurable per event type, ensuring sensitive data is either stripped or hashed before it persists.

## Retention
Retention is flexible: keep audit-critical events for years, drop noisy telemetry after hours. Policies are enforceable and transparent.

## Auditability
Events are immutable. Once written, they are never altered. This guarantees that audit trails are trustworthy. No transformations, no hidden surprises.

## Why It Matters
In regulated industries, failing an audit is existential. Obsinity provides the guarantees enterprises need to sleep at night.
