# Query Model

Obsinity’s query model is built for **both operators and analysts**.

## Event Search
Need to debug an outage? Search by `service.id`, event name, outcome, or trace ID. Obsinity gives you the trail of breadcrumbs.

## Metric Reads
Need the bigger picture? Query counters, gauges, or histograms across windows. Obsinity automatically selects the right rollup, ensuring queries stay fast even over large time ranges.

## Flow Views
Obsinity doesn’t just show numbers; it tells stories. Flow views stitch together start and end events, letting you see not just what happened, but how long it took and how often it failed.

## Why It Matters
Data is only valuable if you can move fluidly between the forest and the trees. Obsinity’s query model ensures you can — without changing tools or mental models.
